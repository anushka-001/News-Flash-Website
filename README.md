A simple, static news site that pulls in today‚Äôs top headlines and shows them in a clean, card-based layout.

---

## How It Was Built

1. **Set up the repository and file structure**

   * Created a GitHub repo named `News-Flash-Website`.
   * Added these files and folders:

     * `index.html`
     * `css/styles.css`
     * `js/config.js`
     * `js/app.js`
     * `assets/` (images and icons)

2. **Created the HTML layout (`index.html`)**

   * Added a header with the site title and a light/dark toggle.
   * Inserted a category dropdown for selecting news topics.
   * Included a `<div id="news-container">` to host the news cards.

3. **Styled the page (`css/styles.css`)**

   * Defined CSS variables for colors and typography.
   * Designed a grid layout for news cards (image, headline, snippet, link).
   * Implemented light/dark mode using a CSS class switch.

4. **Configured the API key (`js/config.js`)**

   * Created a constant `API_KEY` placeholder:

     ```js
     const API_KEY = 'YOUR_NEWSAPI_KEY_HERE';
     ```

5. **Developed the JavaScript logic (`js/app.js`)**

   * Fetched data from NewsAPI:

     ```js
     fetch(`https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?category=${category}&apiKey=${API_KEY}`)
     ```
   * Parsed the JSON and generated HTML cards for each article.
   * Injected the cards into `#news-container`.

6. **Added interactivity**

   * **Category filter:** Reloads news when the dropdown value changes.
   * **Theme toggle:** Switches CSS classes on `<body>` to change themes.

7. **Committed changes step by step**

   * Initial empty file commit
   * Added HTML layout
   * Added CSS styling
   * Set up config file
   * Implemented fetch and render logic
   * Enhanced interactivity (dropdown and theme switch)

8. **Deployed with GitHub Pages**

   * Configured GitHub Pages to serve from the `master` branch root.
   * Live URL: `https://anushka-001.github.io/News-Flash-Website/`
